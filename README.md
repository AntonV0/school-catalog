# Project Name
## Project #38 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
The School Catalog is an application made up of JavaScript classes. The aim of this project is to further understand class syntax and its inheritance. The parent "School" class passes down its properties, getters, setters, and methods to the subclasses "Primary", "Middle", and "High".
## What I Learned
  - Class syntax and inheritance
  - Creating class instances
  - Displaying specific properties from an instance
